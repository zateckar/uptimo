Alembic Migration Directory

This directory contains Alembic migration files for future database schema changes.

Current Status:
- No migration scripts present (fresh database setup)
- Ready for future migrations when the application is deployed

Usage:
1. After modifying models, generate a migration:
   uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

2. Apply migrations to existing databases:
   uv run alembic upgrade head

For fresh database setup, the application uses db.create_all() directly.
